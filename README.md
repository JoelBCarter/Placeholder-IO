# Placeholder-IO
Placeholder IO Plugin for Johnny-Five. The goal is to allow code & unit tests to function without an actual board, possibly by using some combination
of user-defined callbacks to simulate the results of actual IO transactions. This should greatly aid in the prototyping phase by not requring an actual
board to develop with.
